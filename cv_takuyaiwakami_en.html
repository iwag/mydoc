<section class="objective">
  <p>
    Software engineer with a background in hardware (especially computer architecture).
    Main experience is in the areas of video/live search, back end with massive requests, performance tuning, and hardware development.
    <br/>I am interested in an improvement of performance and user experience. I adapt to any field of software quickly.
    In my career, I changed from embedded engineer to web engineer but I had successfully achieved targets in those sides.

    </dt>
      Software Engineer (January 2014 - Present)<br>
      <i>
  Joined the search team which is responsible for for the overall Niconico platform search comprising 20+ million pieces of content.</i>
        <ul>

        <li>Designed new search APIs (RESTful) using Scala and finagle (twitter’s a-synchronized functional library,) while preserving maintainable and high performance. Decreased the number of lines in old codes written in C++ and other languages by 57%, which reduced the costs to maintain the system. These APIs are incorporated into the main Niconico video search engine.</li>
        <li>Created O(1) algorithm with lower memory usage to successfully implement a new sort option using Elasticsearch scripting. This assists users to find popular content, leading to an 8% increase in CTR from the original sort option.</li>
        <li>Reviewed system architecture and tuned JVM of Elasticsearch cluters, which in effect improved acceptance throughput of search API by 1.6 times.</li>
        <li>Maintained a search page which is single page application using Javascript, less, websocket.</li>
        </li>

        </dt>
          Software Engineer (April 2011 - December 2013)<br>
          <i>
            Participated in the system integration team.  To solve customers' problems, we provided software optimization and development/support for accelerators such as CELL B.E., GPGPU and FPGA.</i>
          <ul>
            <li>Using Java and JNI, integrated Fixstars’s high-speed image-processing framework(C++) into the analysis software of Olympus fluorescent microscope, used by leading research for cancer biology or iPS and pluripotent cells. Completed successfully its difficult integration and won the president’s award.</li>
            <li>In the development of a future NAND flash memory's firmware on tiny embedded ARM in C/C++. Led a team of 3 developers and optimized WRITE cache of the firmware to exploit the device. The outcome was the adoption of this chip by Qualcomm and Samsung evaluation boards.</li>
            <li>Our team optimized the image analysis software of industrial inspection equipment. Ported from Verilog HDL/FPGA to CUDA/NVidia GPU.</li>

    <strong>Nara Institute of Science and Technology</strong> <span class="duration">(April 2009 - March 2011)</span><br>
            Master of Information Science, Computer Architecture Major.</p>
    <p>
    <strong>New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization's project on next-generation highly energy-efficient accelerator</strong> <span class="duration">(April 2009 - March 2011)</span><br>
        Designed the cache module to utilize ALU array of the accelerator for parallel execution in Verilog HDL and ran it on FPGA.
          Proposed and integrated a unique time-sharing approach for ALU array, as a result of evaluation reduced the implementation area by 84% from the original implementation area.
